# My Virtual Pet App

Module: Mobile Platforms Applications

Brief: Produce an app utilizing as many utilities as possible

Engine: Android Java

Grade: 1st

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did: 

Produced Login Screen and Linked to FireBase, to allow for account creation and login from different locations

Produced functionality to interact with pet, including feeding and playing

Stored data about the users pet on FireBase, which would then be copied to local files on launch, and on the next launch, it would update the FireBase.

This would mean that the app wouldnt need constant access to the internet, however you would need to be connected to the internet to go onto another device.

Build in the bluetooth features i planned to.
